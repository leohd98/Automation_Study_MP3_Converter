First automation study using Selenium on Python.
I made this program to help my mom to convert and donwload songs that she like from Youtube!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: The program has a flaw.
I use the code line 'time.sleep(time)' so the program can wait for the site to load, and for the song to be converted and downloaded.
I think it works fine with songs that are 4 minutes long on average, but if you try to download something longer, like a 20min song, then probably the 30 seconds i added on some of the waiting steps of the program wont be enough.
In that case, it must be manually changed, this problem will be fixed in my next automation. 
Thanks, enjoy.
